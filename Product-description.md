This is the description of a new JBit product. I want an web application to generate an signature for mail clients. Need to have all Microsoft clients and MacOS mail. This end user needs to fill out the information which needs to come in the signature. This with following fields: Name, Jobrole, Phone, Logo of company. Add also some icons with link to Linkedin, Facebook and X. so also for that the URL needs to be provided. if it is not filled in the icon shouldn't be presented.
